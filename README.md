# DVD Rental Customer Segmentation

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer rental patterns in a DVD rental business and segment customers based on their rental behaviors. Using K-Means Clustering, we categorize customers into distinct groups to provide insights into their preferences and improve business decision-making.

## Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer rental data.
Apply K-Means Clustering to segment customers based on key rental attributes.
Identify customer groups and their characteristics to enhance marketing strategies.
Provide visualizations and insights to support data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about customers, rental history, and related attributes, including:
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Number of Rentals: Total number of DVDs rented.
Rental Frequency: How often a customer rents DVDs.
Spending Pattern: Total amount spent on rentals.
Preferred Categories: Genre preferences for DVD rentals.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values and outliers.
Normalize numerical features for better clustering results.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualize rental trends and customer behaviors.
Identify patterns in customer interactions with the service.
Customer Segmentation using K-Means
Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
Apply K-Means clustering algorithm.
Analyze and interpret customer segments.
Visualization & Insights
Present findings through plots and dashboards.
Provide recommendations for marketing and customer retention strategies.

## Technologies Used
Python: Data manipulation and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: Data preprocessing and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: Clustering algorithm implementation.

## Results & Insights
Customers were segmented into different groups based on their rental behaviors.
High-value customers were identified, allowing targeted marketing efforts.
Rental trends helped optimize inventory management.

## How to Run the Project
Install required dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess data and perform clustering:
python customer_segmentation.py
View and analyze the generated visualizations and insights.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into customer behaviors using K-Means Clustering, enabling data-driven decision-making for improving customer engagement and business profitability.
