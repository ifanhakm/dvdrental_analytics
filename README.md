# DVD Rental Store - Data Analysis

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project performed on the classic DVD Rental sample database. This project aims to extract actionable business insights from the data by leveraging SQL for complex querying and Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data manipulation and visualization.

## 📖 About The Project

The primary goal of this analysis is to answer key business questions that could help a DVD rental store improve its operations and marketing strategies. By diving deep into the relational database, this project seeks to understand customer purchasing habits, identify top-performing films and genres, and uncover other valuable business metrics.

The analysis is documented step-by-step in the Jupyter Notebook, covering the entire process from data cleaning to final insight presentation.
